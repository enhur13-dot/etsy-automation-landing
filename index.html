  <h1>Etsy Automation App</h1>

  <p>
    This is the official landing page for my private Etsy automation tool.  
    The application connects my Etsy shop with Make.com and AI components  
    in order to automatically generate draft listings from uploaded product images.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tool is used exclusively for managing my own shop.  
    It is not offered publicly and does not process data for any third parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    All generated listings remain under my full control and are manually reviewed  
    before being published on Etsy.
